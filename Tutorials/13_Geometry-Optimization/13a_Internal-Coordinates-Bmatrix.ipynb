A stretching coordinate is added for every two bonded atoms, and a bending coordinate is added for all unique A-B-C sequences of connected atoms. For this example of ammonium, there are no dihedral angles.  However, if present, any bonded sequence A-B-C-D is taken to define a dihedral coordinate that is added to the set of optimization coordinates.  (If linear or near-linear bends are present, then 2 orthogonal bends are used to describe the situation, and dihedral coordinates which contain these linear bends must be avoided.  This complication is not further explored here.)"

    "## Redundant Coordinates\n",
    "These simple internal coordinates have many advantages. They tend to produce a strongly diagonal energy second derivative matrix (Hessian), and they have force constants which are readily guessable, i.e., transferable from one molecule to another. In these two respects, they are vastly superior to Cartesian coordinates.\n",

    "For many years, the primary difficulty was that the simple procedure demonstrated here generates too many coordinates. Non-linear molecules have $3N-6$ internal degrees of freedom (where $N$ is the number of atoms), but including all the internal coordinates defined by the bond connectivity will generally produce more than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ammonium, we see that we have 10 coordinates, while the ion has only 9 internal degrees of freedom. Various alternative coordinate systems were explored, for example \"delocalized coordinates\" [J.Baker, A. Kessi, and B. Delley, _J. Chem. Phys._, 105, 192 (1996)], and \"natural internal coordinates\" [G. Fogarasi, X. Zhou, P.W. Taylor, and P. Pulay, _J. Am. Chem. Soc._, 114, 8191 (1992)].  However, an elegant and robust solution turned out to be simply to work with a redundant set and to make the necessary mathematical adjustments.  This approach was advanced by P. Pulay and G. Fogarasi [_J. Chem. Phys._, 96, 2856 (1992)]."
